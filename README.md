# UN-5.2C-Complete
This is a JBC-specific soldering control board derived from the latest UniSolder 5.2C. 
It can be installed in a much smaller case and supplied by 24VDC SMPS to save more rooms. 
Many metal case with 88X38mm front panel and lots chinese-cloned STM32 "T12" soldering station are
compatible with this modified version of UN5.2, which further reduces the cost and complexity of this project. 

Do it at your own risk. The files are provided "AS-IS".

Unfortunately, you have to be a bit familiar with the original UN project. You can generate BOM by using Altium.
Further files such as BOM and manual will be released soon.
